# Citation Standards

When presenting information from web search results:

## Inline Citations

- **Every claim must have an inline citation** using markdown links: [Source Title](URL)
- Only cite URLs that appear in the search output — never invent or guess URLs
- Do not leave any factual claim uncited

## Response Structure

- Lead with the key answer or finding
- Include specific facts, names, numbers, and dates
- Cite every fact inline as [Source Title](url)
- Organize by theme if covering multiple topics

## Sources Section

**End every search response with a Sources section** listing all referenced URLs:

```
Sources:
- [Source Title](https://example.com/article) (Feb 2026)
- [Another Source](https://example.com/other) (Jan 2026)
```

This Sources section is mandatory. Do not omit it.
