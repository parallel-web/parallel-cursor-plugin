# URL Extraction

Extract content from: $ARGUMENTS

## Command

Choose a short, descriptive filename based on the URL or content (e.g., `vespa-docs`, `react-hooks-api`). Use lowercase with hyphens, no spaces. Substitute it into the command **inline** — `$FILENAME` is a placeholder, not a shell variable.

```bash
parallel-cli extract "$ARGUMENTS" --json -o "/tmp/$FILENAME.json"
```

Concrete example:

```bash
parallel-cli extract "https://docs.parallel.ai" --json -o "/tmp/parallel-docs.json"
```

Note: `-o` always saves JSON. The extension must be `.json`.

Options if needed:
- `--objective "focus area"` to focus extraction on a specific goal (also silences the "neither objective nor search_queries" warning that V1 emits when neither is set)
- `-q "keyword"` (repeatable) to prioritize keywords in excerpts
- `--full-content` to include the complete page body (for long articles, PDFs, or when excerpts may not capture what you need)
- `--full-content-max-chars N` to cap full-content size per result
- `--no-excerpts` to strip excerpts when you only want full content

## Handling failed extractions

If the response has an `errors` field, an empty `results` array, or a 404/timeout for the URL, do NOT fabricate content. Tell the user the extraction failed, surface the upstream status, and suggest:
- Verifying the URL (the page may have moved)
- Retrying with `--full-content` if excerpts came back empty but the page exists
- Using `parallel-cli search` to locate the current URL if the page was renamed

## Response format

Return content as:

**[Page Title](URL)**

Then the extracted content verbatim, with these rules:
- Keep content verbatim - do not paraphrase or summarize
- Parse lists exhaustively - extract EVERY numbered/bulleted item
- Strip only obvious noise: nav menus, footers, ads
- Preserve all facts, names, numbers, dates, quotes

After the response, mention the output file path (`/tmp/$FILENAME.json`) so the user knows it's available for follow-up questions.

## If the `parallel-cli` binary is not installed

If the shell reports `command not found: parallel-cli` (i.e. the binary itself is missing — distinct from a `No such command` error from a stale CLI, which the in-body guidance above covers), **stop immediately**. Do NOT search the web yourself, do NOT use any built-in search tools, and do NOT try to answer the query from your own knowledge. Instead, tell the user:

1. `parallel-cli` is not installed
2. Run `/parallel-setup` to install it
3. Then retry their request
